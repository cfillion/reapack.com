## Installation

Download the corresponding file for your platform matching REAPER's architecture
(not to be confused with the architecture of your operating system).

Follow these steps to install ReaPack:

1. From REAPER: *Options > Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder*
2. Put the downloaded file in the *UserPlugins* subdirectory
3. Restart REAPER. Done!

> **Note:** Users of macOS Catalina or newer may need to click on "Allow Anyway"
> in System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy after launching REAPER once
> for ReaPack to load when installed for the first time.

## Getting started

Upon first launch you are presented with the configuration dialog (*Extensions >
ReaPack > Manage repositories*). Each repository in the list contains a
different set of packages. More can be added using the *Import* button (see
[Import a repository](#import-repositories)).

There are two primary ways to install the resources included in the enabled
repositories:

- Click on  *Browse packages* and pick packages to install. See the [Browse packages](#browse-packages) section of this guide.
- To install everything in bulk instead, click on *Option* and enable *Install
    new packages when synchronizing*. The installation will begin after clicking on OK or Apply.

![Initial configuration](/images/user-guide/initial-configuration.png)

> **Note:** The ReaPack submenu may be missing from your *Extensions* menu if
> the menu was previously customized. Use REAPER's *Customize menus/toolbar*
> dialog to manually add ReaPack's submenu if necessary.
>
> All ReaPack features can also be accessed from the Action List. 

## Synchronize packages

Run *Extensions > ReaPack > Synchronize packages* regularly to refresh the
enabled repositories and automatically update every installed package (including
ReaPack itself) to the latest stable version. This feature can be configured to
install new packages and pre-releases as well (see
[Configuration](#configuration)).

Alternatively, you can manually select which packages to update (or select a
specific version) using the package browser. See [Browse packages](#browse-packages).

![Update changelog](/images/user-guide/update-changelog.png)

## Browse packages

This section covers how to install and manage packages using the package browser
(*Extensions > ReaPack > Browse packages*).

![Browse packages](/images/user-guide/browse-packages.png)

The first column at the left displays the package status:

| Row 1   | Meaning                | Row 2+  | Meaning                   |
| ---     | ---                    | ---     | ---                       |
| *Empty* | Package is uninstalled | *Empty* | No queued actions         |
| i       | Package is installed   | I       | Queued for installation   |
| u       | An update is available | R       | Queued for uninstallation |
| o       | Package is obsolete    | P       | Pin status modified       |
|         |                        | p       | Package is pinned         |

The version column shows both the current installed version and the latest
version available in the repository between parenthesis.

The columns can be customized. Right click on the column header to select which
columns are shown. Left drag with the mouse to move or resize the columns.

### Actions

Right click on a package or a selection of packages to get a menu of available
actions.

![Package actions](/images/user-guide/package-actions.png) ![Selection actions](/images/user-guide/selection-actions.png)

#### Per-package

These per-packages actions are checkboxes that can be toggled:

Install &lt;version&gt;
Update to &lt;version&gt;
: Download and install the latest version of the package. Only stable versions
are selected unless the setting *Enable pre-releases globally* is enabled in
[Options](#options) or the version currently installed is already a pre-release.

Reinstall &lt;version&gt;
: Reinstall the version currently installed

Versions...
: Select a specific version of the package to install (including pre-releases)

Pin current version
: Prevent this package from being automatically updated or detected as obsolete
when synchronizing

Uninstall
: Remove the package from your computer (settings and other files created by the
package itself may be kept)

#### Selection-wide

The selection-wide actions are shown only when more than one package are
selected. Unlike per-package actions these don't act as toggles. Use *Clear
queued actions* to cancel all unapplied changes on every selected package.

### Filtering

![Filtering Options](/images/user-guide/filtering.png)

Search in the list by typing words in the filter box. ReaPack's filtering
algorithm behaves similarly to the Action List. Put quotes around words to get
exact matches: **"midi editor" "note"**.  Use **^** and **$** to match the
start and end of a column's text. Words can be grouped with parenthesis: **(
midi note ) OR utility**. Add **NOT** before a word or a group to invert the
search. Use **OR** between words/groups to match one or the other.

The big button at the top right shows how many packages are currently displayed
and how many are available in total. Click on it to select which type of
packages to show in the browser.

## Configuration

This section covers ReaPack's configuration dialog (*Extensions > ReaPack >
Manage repositories*).

### Manage repositories

Right click on any repository in the list to open the following menu:

![Repository settings](/images/user-guide/repository-settings.png)

Refresh
: Update the package list and metadata from this repository

Install new packages...
: Override *Install new packages when synchronizing* for this repository only (see [Options](#options))

Copy URL
: Put the index URL in the clipboard

Uninstall
: Completely remove this repository including all installed packages it contains

About &lt;repository&gt;
: Open the repository's documentation

### Import repositories

Click on *Import/export > Import repositories* in [Manage
repositories](#manage-repositories) or use the shortcut *Extensions > ReaPack >
Import repositories* to add third-party repositories to ReaPack. You can find
popular repositories in the [Repository list](/repos.html).

![Import repositories](/images/user-guide/import-repositories.png)

The URL to put in this dialog should have been given to you by the owner of the
repository you wish to import. The golden rule of computer security applies to
ReaPack repositories as well: don't install packages from untrusted sources.

### Offline use

ReaPack requires an internet connection by design. However, it is possible to
transfer data and installed packages to another computer using *Export
offline archive* and *Import offline archive* in *Manage repositories >
Import/export*.

For optimal results both computers should run the same operating system and
software architecture. Some packages may provide different files
depending on the system and architecture. Also note that obsolete packages
cannot be imported.

Offline users should disable the setting *Refresh index cache when older than a
week* in *Manage repositories > Options > Network settings* to avoid getting
download failures when using the package browser and other features which would
otherwise attempt to connect to the internet.

### Options

Click on *Options* to get this menu:

![Options](/images/user-guide/options.png)

Install new packages when synchronizing
: Enable to make *Synchronize packages* install every package in the enabled
repositories in addition to installing updates. This setting can also be set on
a per-repository basis (see [Manage repositories](#manage-repositories)).

Enable pre-releases globally (bleeding edge)
: Use this mode to enable updating from a stable version to a pre-release when
synchronizing or when updating from the browser. Pre-releases can always be
manually installed from the package browser even if this setting is disabled.

Prompt to uninstall obsolete packages
: Enable to detect obsolete packages when synchronizing and ask whether to keep
or remove them. A package is obsolete when it was removed from its parent
repository and is no longer available for download.

Network settings
: Use this to configure how ReaPack connects to the internet (eg. to set a proxy
server).

Restore default settings
: Reset options to the factory defaults and restore altered or removed default
repositories.

## Create repository

The simplest way to create your own repository is to fork the [ReaPack Repository Template](https://github.com/cfillion/reapack-repository-template) on GitHub. This repository has ReaPack automatic indexation.  
If you created your repository manually, you can index your packages with [reapack-index](https://github.com/cfillion/reapack-index).

To make your packages compatible with ReaPack, check the file naming conventions and package documentation on the [reapack-index wiki](https://github.com/cfillion/reapack-index/wiki).

## Support
